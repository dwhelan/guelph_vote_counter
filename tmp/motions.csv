                    ZC2305) – Ward 1

Mr. Todd Salter, General Manager of Planning Services, introduced the report and provided a
brief history of the application.


Ms. Katie Nasswetter, Senior Development Planner, highlighted the application for a six (6)
phased mixed use, residential and commercial development on the property known as 5 Arthur
Street South. She reviewed the proposed holding provisions that must be completed before
development can proceed.


Ms. Pamela Kraft was present on behalf of Fusion Homes and advised City documents allow a
12 storey building on the site and the proposed building heights allow flexibility to address
urban design and market demand. She advised the applicant is continuing to examine options
for the development of the heritage building.


Ms. Lin Grist read the statement from Hugh Whiteley who was unable to attend the meeting,
who requested that the policy of acquiring riverside corridors for publicly-owned parks be
maintained and applied to the proposed development at 5 Arthur St. S. He expressed concern
that the proposed easement for public access does not allow the creation of a park as called for

in Official Plan Amendment 43.

Ms. Maria Pezzano, Co-Chair of The Ward Residents’ Association, expressed concern their
Association was not made aware of the change to the height of the central buildings. She

requested that Council limit the three central building’s height to ten stories.

Mr. William Sleeth advised he supports the comments made by the previous delegation. He
expressed concern that no public consultation was sought relating to the change in height of
the central buildings.

Ms. Laura Murr advised she is a member of the Living Rivers and Greenways Group Guelph and
strongly supports public ownership of the river corridor and access to the rivers and their
valleylands. She requested the policy of acquiring riverside corridors be maintained which
would allow for the creation of a park called for in the Official Plan Amendment 43. She
suggested the cash-in-lieu of parkland to be received from this development be used to
